## What is REST?
 REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

## What is an API?
	An Application Programming Interface

## Key points about REST architecture?
	1. We do not transfer actual objects. We instead transfer a representation of it.
		a. We Transfer "JSON" data to represent our mongoDB documents
	2. RESTful services are for exposing a public API over the internet to handle CRUD operations on our data
		a. CRUD stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE
	3. REST is focused on accessing named resources through a single consistent interface.
	4. REST is a theory. How it is implemented is up to us.
	5. Everything is identified by a unique endpoint / URL. there should be 1 endpoint for each resource.
	6. ENDPOINTS consist of a domain name and a resource address to from a URL.
	7. REST API is a way we can provide a URL's to make requests from our applications to interact with our database.
		 With these interactions we can receive and send data to be stored. we can also set up endpoints to sort or filter data that will be send back to the client.
